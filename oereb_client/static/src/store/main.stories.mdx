# Main Store

This application uses [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) to store, manipulate and share
states and data across the whole application. It provides one main store containing a bunch of
slices for different parts and components.

```js
const MainStore = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    config: configReducer,              // Contains the configuration, to be available application-wide
    map: mapReducer,                    // Provides the map instance and some layers
    mapQuery: mapQueryReducer,          // Controls the state and position of the map query component
    extract: extractReducer,            // Provides the extract status and data
    accordion: accordionReducer,        // Controls the visibility of the different categories and topics
    language: languageReducer,          // Controls the language settings
    availability: availabilityReducer,  // Controls the visibility of the availabiliity layer
    symbolZoom: symbolZoomReducer,      // Controls the zoom for legend symbols (enabled/disabled)
    history: historyReducer,            // Controls the extract history (5 latest real estates)
    message: messageReducer             // Controls warning and error messages
  }
});
```
