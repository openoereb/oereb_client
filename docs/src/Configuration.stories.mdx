# Configuration

Basically, you are free how to configure the OeREB Client. All you need
to do is updating the settings dictionary of the Pyramid configuration.
This dictionary has to be extended with an `oereb_client` element that
contains the parameters described below.

It's recommended to use a YAML file, as described in the next section,
but you don't have to.

## Update the Pyramid configuration

> **Note:** This section is not necessary, if the application is run using
the provided container image.

In this example, the configuration file for the OeREB Client is named
`oereb_client.yml`. You can create this file in your application's root
directory.

The next step is to define this file in your application's INI file. For
example, open the *development.ini* file and add the following line
within the *app:main* section:

```
oereb_client.cfg = %(here)s/oereb_client.yml
```

You can call it whatever you want, but it makes sense to use the package
name. You could also use an already existing file, e.g. from
`pyramid_oereb`. The variable `%(here)s` stands for the root directory
and will be replaced by its absolute path.

As you've now defined, where your configuration file is placed, you can
parse its content. Open the `__init__.py` of your application and apply
the follow changes:

1. Add the required imports at the top of the file.

```python
import codecs
import yaml
```

2. Update your `main` method to read and parse the configuration file.
   The location of the configuration is available in the existing
   settings dictionary (from the INI file). To read the configuration,
   it's recommended to use the `codecs` library to avoid errors due to
   special characters. The file content gets parsed using the `yaml`
   library and directly applied onto the settings dictioinary.

```python
def main(global_config, **settings):
    """
    This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
    """
    config = Configurator(settings=settings)
    settings = config.get_settings()
    with codecs.open(settings.get('oereb_client.cfg'), encoding='utf-8') as f:
        settings.update(yaml.load(f.read()).get('vars'))
    ...
    config.scan()
    return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

Now everything is set up to configure the OeREB Client.

## Configure the OeREB Client

Add your configuration in the created `oereb_client.yml` or mount this file into
your container. The top-level element has to be called `oereb_client`. The
following example shows such a configuration and explains the parameters.

> **Note:** The configuration file is parsed using
[pyaml-env](https://github.com/mkaranasou/pyaml_env). This allows you to use
environment variables in your configuration, which will be interpreted when
the configuration is parsed on application start up. Please refer to the
linked project site to see how to use this feature.

### Search

As mentioned in the configuration example above, you have two options to configure the search:

1. use the integrated search proxy or
2. specify an external endpoint for search requests.

The client always sends one search request using the following URL pattern, where
- `<search url>` is the URL of the integrated proxy or the configured external endpoint,
- `<search term>` the entered search value and
- `<language>` the currently selected language.

```
http(s)://<search url>?term=<search term>&lang=<language>
```

**Use the integrated search proxy**

By default, the request described above is sent to the integrated search proxy. The proxy converts
the received request into a single request for each configured search category (E-GRID, address,
real estate, ...). The resulting requests are executed in parallel threads and the results are
aggregated as soon as the last request has finished.

To be able to aggregate the results, they have to match the following structure.

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Search result 1",
    "egrid": "CH1234567890",
    "coordinates": [2600000.0, 1200000.0]
  },
  {
    "label": "Search result 2",
    "egrid": "CH9876543210",
    "coordinates": [2600001.0, 1200001.0]
  },
  ...
]
```

Only one of the attributes `egrid` and `coordinates` is necessary, whereby using `egrid` should be
the preferred solution.

If your configured endpoint for a certain category is not able to return this structure, you can
implement and specify a hook method, which handles the transformation of the results into the
required structure. Please refer to the
[samples package](https://github.com/openoereb/oereb_client/blob/main/samples/search.py) for some
examples on how to implement such a hook method.

**Specify an external endpoint for search requests**

You can bypass the integrated search proxy by setting `search` to an URL of an external search
endpoint. The client will then send each request to the configured URL directly. The external
endpoint needs to accept requests using the pattern described at the beginning of this section.

The returned results need to match the following structure.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Address",             // The category title
    "results": [                    // The results of this category
      {
        "label": "Address 1",
        "coordinates": [2600000.0, 1200000.0]
      },
      {
        "label": "Address 2",
        "coordinates": [2600001.0, 1200001.0]
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  {
    "title": "E-GRID",              // The category title
    "results": [                    // The results of this category
      {
        "label": "CH1234567890",
        "egrid": "CH1234567890"
      },
      {
        "label": "CH9876543210",
        "egrid": "CH9876543210"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```
