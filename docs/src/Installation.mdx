# Installation

Please use the following instructions to install the OeREB Client. The
code samples are based on a Linux system but may be adapted for
Windows environments.

If you want to use the provided container image to run the application,
please refer to the last section of this page.

> **Note:** The usage of a virtual environment is recommended but not
> necessary. For the examples, a virtual environment under ".venv" is
> assumed.

## Requirements

As the OeREB Client is designed as a plugin for the
[Pyramid Web Framework](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/),
you need an existing Pyramid application. If you don't already have one,
please follow the instructions in the Pyramid documentation to set up
the application.

To make use of the front-end application, you also need a back-end part.
For that, you can include
[pyramid\_oereb](https://openoereb.github.io/pyramid_oereb/) in the
same Pyramid application, for example.

Having all set up, you can proceed with installation of the OeREB
Client.

## Download the package

The OeREB Client is available as a
[Python package](https://pypi.org/project/oereb-client/) on the Python
Package Index (PyPI). The recommended way is to install it from there
using `pip`.

```console
.venv/bin/pip install oereb_client
```

If you want to install a certain version of the package, you can
specifiy it. For example:

```console
.venv/bin/pip install oereb_client==2.0.6
```

> **NOTE:** Use the latest release as long as there is no need for a
> certain version.

Alternatively, you could add `oereb_client` to a file, like
*requirements.txt* and use it for downloading:

```console
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **NOTE:** The current development versions are available on TestPyPI
> (https://test.pypi.org/project/oereb-client/).

## Include the plugin

Once you have installed the package into your virtual environment, there
are two ways to include it into your Pyramid application.

### 1. Using `config.include()`

Your Pyramid application should start with a kind of *main* method,
similar to this one:

```python
def main(global_config, **settings):
    """
    This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
    """
    config = Configurator(settings=settings)
    ...
    config.scan()
    return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

To include the plugin, you can add the following line somewhere before
`config.scan()`:

```python
config.include('oereb_client')
```

After restarting the application, the plugin should be loaded, but you
may get some errors because of the still missing configuration.

### 2. Via the application's \*.ini file

Usually you create one or more \*.ini file for a Pyramid application,
e.g. *development.ini* and *production.ini*, where you configure the
application entry point, logging and maybe other global preferences.

It should start similar to this example:

```
###
# module configuration
###

[app:main]
use = egg:oereb_client

pyramid.reload_templates = true
pyramid.default_locale_name = en
...
```

Within the *app:main* section, you can also define plugins to be
included:

```
[app:main]
use = egg:oereb_client

pyramid.reload_templates = true
pyramid.default_locale_name = en

pyramid.includes =
    oereb_client
    any_other_plugin
...
```

After including the plugin, you can proceed with the configuration part.

## Use container image

The container images can be found on GitHub in the
[project's container registry](https://github.com/openoereb/oereb_client/pkgs/container/oereb_client).

To configure the application, you have to mount your configuration file into the container using
`/app/oereb_client.yml` as mount path.

You can adjust the log level using the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL`.

> **NOTE:** *pyramid\_oereb* has to be run in a separate container. You have to use the configuration
> parameter `service_url` to specify the root URL of your OeREB web service.
